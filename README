In this repository, I will try to implement the signature generation and the
signature verification procedures for ECDSA.  The first curve I am going to
play with is secp256r1.  Note that the curve secp256r1 may have a different
name based on which context we are in.  Here are three commonly used names for
the same curve:

    - secp256r1 (SECG SEC 2)
    - prime256v1 (ANSI X9.62)
    - P-256 (NIST)
